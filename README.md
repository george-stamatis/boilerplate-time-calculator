# Time Calculator

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certification. The Time Calculator involves writing a Python function called add_time that adds a duration time to a start time.

# Project Description

The add_time function takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

- a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
- a duration time indicating the number of hours and minutes
- (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
The function adds the duration time to the start time and returns the result. It also handles cases where the result spans to the next day or multiple days later. Additionally, if the optional starting day of the week parameter is given, the output displays the day of the week of the result.

This project is written in Python.
